# Object-detection-with-feedback

## About the project
It is a project to elevate people with impaired eyesight. 
The project deals with object detection technology to detect obstacles in the way and give voice feedback. This project is developed to help people with impaired eyesight. It alerts the user about the upcoming obstacle, its distance from the user, and its location. This will help the user to move safely.
The project is deployed over a web API using flask as a backend.

# Transfer Learning

When training models over images, the network captures low-level features in their early layers of training. These features may be like detecting edges, colors, variations of intensities. These features may be beneficial while training other models. Thus learning these features in one task can be used in other tasks. This sharing of knowledge known as transfer learning.
